This is the official repository for the CME466 course presented at the Computer and Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Saskatchewan.
This is a design oriented course aimed at the implementation of an advanced digital system following a system-on-a-chip (SoC) design methodology. The objective of this course is to apply knowledge learned in previous courses to design, implement and test a complex digital system. The design problem and design process will change from time to time to reflect the latest trends of technology and industry need. Students will be guided through the design and implementation of the system from both hardware and software aspects.
